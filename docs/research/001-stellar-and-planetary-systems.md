## Summary of Star Characteristics and Planetary Systems

| Star Class | Star Size (Solar Radii) | Colour | Planet Occurrence & Typical Sizes |
|------------|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|
| **O-type** | 10-20+ | Blue | Rare planets; detection limited by stellar evolution and short lifespans[1] |
| **B-type** | 3-10 | Blue-white | Very few detected; massive stars inhibit planet formation and retention[1] |
| **A-type** | 1.5-3 | White | Higher probability of gas giants; rapid rotation complicates detection[2] |
| **F-type** | 1.1-1.5 | Yellow-white | ~30% occurrence rate; fewer small planets than G/K/M types[3][4] |
| **G-type** | 0.9-1.1 | Yellow (Sun-like) | ~11% host Earth-size planets; 1.2% have Hot Jupiters; 3-4.5% have giant planets <100 days[1][5] |
| **K-type** | 0.6-0.9 | Orange | ~80% occurrence rate; more frequent small planets than G-type[4] |
| **M-type** | 0.1-0.6 | Red | **Highest planet frequency**: ~40% host super-Earths in habitable zones; Earth-to-Neptune planets 2-3× more common than around Sun-like stars[3][6] |

### Key Patterns

**Planet Frequency Trend**: M > K > G > F > A > B > O - smaller, cooler stars host significantly more planets, particularly Earth-to-Neptune sized worlds.[3][4]

**Planet Size Distribution**: Red dwarfs favor small planets (super-Earths and mini-Neptunes), while more massive stars show higher rates of giant planets.[1][2]

**Detection Bias**: Current statistics are influenced by observational methods. Radial velocity surveys favor massive planets around Sun-like stars, while transit methods excel at finding smaller planets around red dwarfs.[7]
